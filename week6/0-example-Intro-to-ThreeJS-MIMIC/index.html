    // First we need to set up some objects and initialise them.
    // Three.js provides a canvas automatically so we don't need that.
    // This creates a camera. It has a field of view, a size, a near clipping plane and a far clipping plane
    var camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(70, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 1, 1000);
    // We need to create a scene and add things to it.
    var scene = new THREE.Scene();
    // Now we are goint to create some built in geometry
    // It's a box.
    var geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1);
    // We are going to want to texture the box.
    // To do this we need a texture loader object to load the texture
    var myTextureLoader = new THREE.TextureLoader();
    // Then we can load the texture into a variable
    var myTexture = myTextureLoader.load('sgpic10.jpg');
    // Now we need to create a material
    // This defines how the surface of the object reflects light
    // We're using Phong. There are lots of other types.
    var material = new THREE.MeshPhongMaterial({map: myTexture});
    // We can now create a mesh using the geomentry and the material
    var mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
    // If we want to see stuff, we will need a light.
    // The argument is the colour of the light in hexadecimal.
    var light = new THREE.DirectionalLight("rgb(255,255,255)");
    // Now we can create our renderer. Thiis renders the scene.
    var renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();

    // Now we can set some variables for the objects.
    camera.position.z = 2;
    // Notice we can also us the set method to position things.
    //light.position.z = 2;
    light.position.set(0, 2, 2);
    // Now we add the mesh and the light to the scene.
    scene.add(mesh);
    scene.add(light);
    // This is to make sure that the scene understands the resolution of the device we are on.
    renderer.setPixelRatio(window.devicePixelRatio);
    // We can also set the size of the render window
    renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
    // Finally we want to connect the renderer to the HTML document
    document.body.appendChild(renderer.domElement);
    // And make sure that when the page is resized, everything gets updated
    window.addEventListener('resize', onWindowResize, false);

    //  Now we can have a draw loop.
    function draw() {
        mesh.rotation.x += 0.005;
        mesh.rotation.y += 0.01;
        //camera.position.x += 0.01;
        renderer.render(scene, camera);
        requestAnimationFrame(draw);
    }

    // This is the thing that does the resizing
    function onWindowResize() {
        camera.aspect = window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight;
        camera.updateProjectionMatrix();
        renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
    }

    // Finally, call the draw loop.
    requestAnimationFrame(draw());
